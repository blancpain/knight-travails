# Knight Travails

### Implementation of the knight travails algorithm - finding the shortest path a knight can take from a given starting square to a given destination. The code uses an implementation of a graph that is represented by an adjacency list. The vertices are all the squares on the chess board and the edges are all the legal moves a knight can make. The legal moves are populated using a generator function. 

### The algo uses BFS to find the shortest path and display all the steps from the starting square to the destination.
